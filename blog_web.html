            <h4>Internet and Web programming: </h4>
            <p>The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers and servers that allows people to communicate, share information, and access resources from anywhere in the world. Web programming involves creating dynamic websites that are interactive and user-friendly. This includes the use of databases, server-side scripting, and client-side scripting to create applications that can process data, display content, and interact with users.
            </p>
            <h4>What is Internet and Web programming?</h4>
            <p>The Internet is a global network of interconnected computer systems that enables communication and the sharing of information across the world. The Internet has revolutionized the way people communicate, learn, and conduct business. Web programming refers to the development of web applications and websites that are accessed over the Internet. Web programming involves creating web pages, web applications, and other online content that can be displayed in a web browser. Web programming is accomplished using a variety of programming languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Java. Each of these languages has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of language depends on the needs of the project. The Internet is a vast network of computers, and servers, which communicate with each other. The Internet is a vast network that connects billions of computers and other electronic devices all around the world. You can get nearly any information, communicate with anyone on the globe, and do a lot more with the Internet. All of this is possible by connecting a computer to the Internet, generally known as going online. When someone says a computer is online, they are simply referring to the fact that it is linked to the Internet.</p>

            <h4>How Does Internet and Web Programming Work?</h4>
            <h6>1. Client-side</h6>
            <p>First, when we type a URL like www.google.com, the browser converts it into a file containing

GET /HTTP/1.1 (where GET means we are requesting some data from the server and HTTP refers to a protocol that we are using, 1.1 refers to the version of the HTTP request)
Host: www.google.com
And some other information
Now this file is converted to binary code by the browser and it is sent down the wires if we are connected through Ethernet and if we are using WiFi, first it converts it to a radio signal which is decoded by a router in a very low level. It is converted to binary and then sent to the servers. This information or ‘binary codes’ go to the destination and responds if it is received by the sender only because of the IP address. One router will send the information to another and this keeps on going until the binary codes reach the destination. </p>
            <h6>2. Server-side</h6>
            <p>Now the server receives the binary code and decodes it and sends the response in the following manner: 

HTTP/1.1 200 ok (where 200 ok is the status)
Content-type:type/HTML
Body of page
Now, this is converted back to binary by the server and sent to the IP address that is requesting it. Once the codes are received by the client, the browser again decodes the information in the following way

First, it checks the status
It starts reading the document from the HTML tag and constructs a Tree-like structure.
The HTML tree is then converted to corresponding binary code and rendered on the screen.
In the end, we see the website front-end.
Below is the tree structure of the HTML document</p>
            <h6>3. Protocols</h6>
            <p>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the primary protocol used for communication on the web. Clients send HTTP requests to servers, which respond with HTTP responses. HTTPS (HTTP Secure) is a secure version of HTTP that encrypts data transferred between the client and server.</p>
            <h4>Uses of  Internet and Web programming</h4>
            <p>Communication: The Internet has revolutionized communication, allowing people to connect with each other through email, social media, video conferencing, and instant messaging.
Information sharing: The Internet has made it possible to access vast amounts of information quickly and easily. Websites like Wikipedia and news sites provide up-to-date information on a wide range of topics.
E-commerce: The Internet has enabled businesses to sell products and services online, creating new opportunities for entrepreneurs and small businesses.
Education: The Internet has opened up new opportunities for education, making it possible for people to learn online through MOOCs, webinars, and other online courses.
Entertainment: The Internet has transformed the way we consume entertainment, with streaming services like Netflix and YouTube providing access to movies, TV shows, and other content.</p>
            <h4>Issues in Internet and Web programming</h4>
            <p>Security: Security is a critical concern in web programming, as hackers can exploit
vulnerabilities
in web applications to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or cause damage. Developers need to implement strong security measures to protect against these threats.
Compatibility: The Internet and web programming involve a wide range of devices, browsers, and operating systems. Ensuring compatibility across all of these platforms can be a significant challenge for developers.
Performance: Web applications need to be responsive and perform well, even under heavy loads. This requires careful optimization of code, server infrastructure, and other resources.
Accessibility: Web applications need to be accessible to people with disabilities, including those who use assistive technologies like screen readers or voice recognition software.
Privacy: As web applications collect and process user data, privacy concerns have become increasingly important. Developers need to implement strong privacy policies and ensure that user data is protected.
Usability: Web applications need to be easy to use and navigate, with intuitive interfaces that provide a positive user experience.</p>
